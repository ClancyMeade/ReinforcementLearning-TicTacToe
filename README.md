# Q-Learning with TicTacToe
In this project I used Reinforcement Learning to train two agents to play TicTacToe. 
I implemented Q-Learning in java to train each agent.

### Usage 
```java 

// Train player1 against a random player2 
make trainP1

// Train player2 against a random player1
make trainP2

// Train both players against eachother 
make train

// Play against the computer 
make play
```
