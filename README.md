# Q-Learning with TicTacToe
In this project I used Reinforcement Learning to train two agents to play TicTacToe. 
I implemented Q-Learning in java from scratch to train each agent.

### Usage 
```make

# Train player1 against a random player2 
make trainP1

# Train player2 against a random player1
make trainP2

# Train both players against eachother 
make train

# Play against the computer 
make play
```
